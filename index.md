### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    The entirety of Lab 1 was a favorite because it was probably the easiest lab we had to do and helped famialarize myself with github and linux. It was fun meeting my fellow classmates during that lab. It was also a good learning experience for what I was getting into in the future of the class.

* Lab 4

    The entirety of Lab 4 was a favorite because the assignment involved practical coding tasks, such as editing source files, implementing functions, and testing the program. This hands-on experience was crucial for reinforcing my programming skills. The program I was building was not just theoretical; it had a real-world application in converting measurements between different systems which I really liked.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because the assignment emphasized the use of standard library functions in C++, such as ifstream for file handling, stoi for string-to-integer conversion, and reverse iterators for reversing strings, which showcased the power and convenience of the C++ standard library. I also liked how the assignment introduced complexity gradually. It started with the concept of prime numbers, then progressed to file handling, string manipulation, and optimization. This incremental complexity ensured that I could build on my knowledge and skills step by step.
